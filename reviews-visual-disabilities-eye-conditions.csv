AccuWeather: Weather Radar,WEATHER,vision problem,I recently downloaded this from Google. I was fed up with my original weather app that came with my older Samsung. The ads for this are too big for the screen and too aggressive. If someone has vision problems as I do then this is not the app for you.

Airbnb,TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL,visually impaired,I'm visually impaired. So I have to use special software on my phone and computer to view things that other people take for granted.

Amazon Alexa,LIFESTYLE,sight problem,I would probably do more with Alexa if I had a written list of voice commands preferably in related groups rather than just alphabetical. Alexa is useful for anyone with sight problems or arthritis in their hands but for older people the use of apps is far from 'intuitive ' and the 'getting started' leaflet was extremely brief.

Amazon Kindle,BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE,blind,I am a blind person and that makes using this app extremely difficult. A built-in read-aloud feature because not all the books on the Kindle store offer an Audible version would solve a lot of problems because text-to-speech doesn't work when trying to read my books aloud — in my case that is.

The text to speech also seems to have some issues with holding my place after closing the app. All in all it seems to be a pretty solid app. There are no issues with crashing or anything like that.

Amazon Kindle,BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE,blind,I have a lot of books in the Amazon ecosystem so this is great for me. They seem to have solved the brightness problem - it used to blind you when using it in a dark area. It's faster than before at downloads and overall very responsive.

Amazon Kindle,BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE,blind,Its a really great app and all that. My only complain is that reading in the dark is an uncomfortable experience even in the Dark mode because the letters are still white and appear really bright in low light making it really a challenge to read without tilting the device awkwardly.

It's a waste of my time and its a pain in the behind. especially when your only book for class won't open for continual use. Then there's the God-awful screen brightness which is causing eye strain. Most of my books are on this app. Its really crappy that no matter how you turn down the brightness it is always going to burn your eyeballs - that is when the app is actually working.

Amazon Kindle,BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE,eye strain,I love amazon and kindle so much than any other things because of the wide range of books low money and good app and device kindle but I always in need black layout with white wordsplease.

Amazon Kindle,BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE,eye strain,Can't seem to find any version of a dark night mode for reading kindle books in the dark without a bright white screen causing eye strain in a dark room. If one gets added or if someone can reply to this post instructing me how to do it I'll upgrade my rating accordingly. Using this app on a Galaxy s10e.,NEGATIVE,eyestrain,3,2019-07-11T05:39:32.453Z,
Amazon Kindle,BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE,eye strain,Great app with limitations. Biggest issues is that when reading comics you can't enlarge the panels to a point where eye strain isn't an issue. Hope they fix this.,NEGATIVE,eyestrain,3,2020-07-17T03:40:20.215Z,
Amazon Kindle,BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE,eye strain,I don't know why the Kindle app brightness trumps the system brightness setting. Is it bad for my eyes when reading in almost complete darkness to have the screen as dim as possible? Might I suggest a pop-up to tell me I might cause eye strain if that is the reason.,NEGATIVE,eyestrain,3,2021-04-06T15:25:02.525Z,
Amazon Kindle,BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE,eye strain,Books work and you can customize it for the least amount of eye strain my only issue is that there's no scrolling. It's kind of cute that it's like turning pages but part of why I don't read often is because I can't focus on a page at a time like the app forces me to. So overall it's good I just wish I had the option to scroll instead of turning pages.,POSITIVE,eyestrain,4,2016-05-02T17:32:43.310Z,

Amazon Kindle,BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE,eye strain,Also glad they support manga style right to left since most translations keep that style when importing. Still not super happy with any comic book reader I've tried yet but reading books on this app works great as long as I use computer glasses that help prevent eye strain.,NEGATIVE,eyestrain,4,2012-10-24T22:06:32.680Z,
Amazon Kindle,BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE,eye strain,I was using this app with until one day the background was dimly lit and I could find no control to make it brighter. I wear glasses & this might be a deal breaker as I need the light to avoid eye strain. Other than that is a great reader love the way it automatically book marks across all devices. I've sent a message to the developer through the app if this I issue is adjustable and I simply can't find it then I recommend the app. Is the only reason I did not give 5 stars.,NEGATIVE,eyestrain,4,2014-12-30T19:10:11.190Z,

Amazon Kindle,BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE,eye strain,For 99% of my uses this app is great. I use it on dark mode to prevent eye strain.

Amazon Kindle,BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE,eye strain,I was a bit leery to try the app on my phone because my eyesight isn't the best and didn't want to end up with a font so big I only had four words per screen. However the print is clear and easily read. I use the sepia setting to avoid eye strain. Books download and sync up with my actual Kindle very quickly with no fuss.

Amazon Kindle,BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE,eye strain,Life Changing. as an avid reader I love bringing my entire library along with a bookstore everywhere I go! As a Prime Member I can always find free books to supplement my favorite authors. Best purchase I have made in a very long time. No eye strain like a computer may give with its backlit screen.

Perfect!,POSITIVE,eyestrain,5,2021-09-04T17:37:50.290Z,
Amazon Kindle,BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE,eyestrain,It seems android users arnt really that welcome in the kindle community. As useful and handy as this app should be to someone who reads as much as I do the simple fact that you CANNOT adjust text size is truly pathetic. For those who require glasses or get eyestrain having to suffer through text this small is a nightmare.,NEGATIVE,eyestrain,1,2014-08-09T23:34:02.689Z,

Amazon Kindle,BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE,eyestrain,Luvin it. I do not own a kindle. So I guess I don't know what I'm missing. What I DO have is my entire library at my fingertips. Can read whatever whenever & wherever I want. Different colors of backgrounds & choice of letter sizes to help with any kind of eyestrain there might be a problem with. I like to read in bed. No fumbling with the pages. Just tap to the next one. Can even adjust how bright it is so as not to bother my husband. No fumbling to turn off a light. Also great space saver,POSITIVE,eyestrain,5,2014-01-11T07:55:51.507Z,
Amazon Kindle,BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE,eyestrain,For me it's intuitive. I can do with the app what I have on my mind. I can highlight a word or a set of words when I turn on after leaving the app it tells me where I left off. I can search my personal kindle library with ease. When using my mobile I can photographed a page and save to storeage in my case Google Keep with that screen shot I can crop a section of it like a graph or diagram and save. It's easy to read in terms of eyestrain. I like it.,POSITIVE,eyestrain,5,2021-06-02T20:15:22.343Z,

Amazon Kindle,BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE,light sensitivity,I use this more than i use my phone as an actual phone. *Edit* Due to the latest update I have lost a lot of ability to use this app while I have a headache due to light sensitivity. This is heart breaking as reading in dark mode (with my brightness all the way down and blue light turned off) was one of the things I could do to take my mind off of my misery when a migraine hits. I might as well go back to actual books. At least they don't *glow*.,NEGATIVE,photophobia,1,2021-05-10T03:12:12.279Z,
Amazon Kindle,BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE,"light sensitivity, talkback",Bring back Read Aloud! 'TalkBack' accessibility through the phone settings is tolerable at best. Please copy Google Play Books 'Read Aloud' functions that highlight what's being read while displaying the full page without the content/navigating bar covering a large portion of the page with dark mode enabled for readers with light sensitivity.

Amazon Kindle,BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE,low vision,Ebooks are such a wonderful idea but Amazon really ruins it with the app. On the version that came on my Fire 7 they have light text on light backgrounds over all they have small and icons that cannot be zoomed and they don't have a speech generator to allow you to listen to books that do not have audio.

Amazon Kindle,BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE,photophobia,If you have photophobia like me the removal of dark mode in all amazon apps (this and shopping) recently will render it unusable.

Amazon Kindle,BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE,photophobia,This app used to be worth 4 stars (lost 1 star for inability to search only Prime books) but easily lost another star by removing 'Themes' from the Settings menu. I suffer from photophobia (no I'm not afraid of photographs) so bright light hurts my eyes to the point where migraines can be triggered.

Easy to use tells me my reading speed and suggests other titles to read,POSITIVE,photophobia,5,2021-10-27T16:43:51.755Z,
Amazon Kindle,BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE,sight impaired,So I've been using the Kindle app for years and have hundreds of titles. The latest update has made it nearly impossible for me to use it though. As far as I can tell they took away Dark Mode for some strange reason. I'm sight impaired and the more light there is the less I see. I can't really tell what I'm looking at in the main library page now without wearing my protective sunglasses. Also I can't seem to download anything. I HATE THIS! Fix it or I won't ever buy from you again,NEGATIVE,partial vision,1,2021-05-08T16:34:17.714Z,
Amazon Kindle,BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE,sight impaired,For reading this is a brilliant app but for listening the app needs some work. For someone who is sight impaired the controls are very challenging especially compared to amazon's audible. Trying to get back to a chapter or a specific place is not easy. Bit more frustrating is trying to download the book. If you lose signal in the process the download reverts to the beginning again. Unlike audible you also cannot play the book until you are extremely far along in the download. Finally the sound files are really large double the size of audible. Look forward to this app becoming more user friendly then will certainly rate the app 5 stars,NEGATIVE,partial vision,4,2017-04-17T17:03:25.900Z,

Amazon Kindle,BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE,talk back,I o like this but as I struggle to read at times I like the option to listen too.

Amazon Kindle,BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE,talk back,Like the app and love all the free books that I can get but really wish that text to speech option was built into the android version as it is in the pc version. One of my prime times for getting some reading done is on my way to work. I know I can get it to work with talk back but it is troublesome and affects all the functions of my phone plus I have to keep the screen on and don't dare touch anything or it will stop. Please consider adding this as an update. I won't be buying any paid books at this time in part because this feature is missing. I have another free app called Evie on my phone which does this brilliantly using the engine already on my phone why can't you do the same?,NEGATIVE,visual impairment,3,2020-09-02T15:39:32.227Z,

Amazon Kindle,BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE,talk back,The program is very good those who like reading from the screen it is perfect. It cooperates nicely with talk back reading aloud.

Amazon Kindle,BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE,talk back,I love books. I am a Kindle Unlimited customer and I love how this app interfaces with the Amazon Fire Phone. Specifically the play button to let it read to you. There needs to be a play button for ALL devices to keep users from needing to turn on Talk Back. Like NEEDS.....please!!!

Amazon Kindle,BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE,talkback,You can guarantee I won't be buying any more books via kindle until the kindle app for android starts supporting text to speech. I buy books to listen to with text to speech. The only way to work around it was with talkback and that didn't work well at all if I was horribly seeing impaired... there's no way that would have worked for me. It was so horribly unpleasant that I will not be doing it again. It depreciated what would have been a lovely book experience. Please fix this!,NEGATIVE,visual impairment,1,2014-04-07T11:53:16.850Z,
Amazon Kindle,BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE,talkback,Doesn't have built in text to speech in the app. If you want to have text to speech then you have to use the Android TalkBack which sounds terrible and mades getting to the Kindle app a pain.

Amazon Kindle,BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE,talkback,I needed kindle to read aloud while doing some task or work.

Amazon Kindle,BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE,talkback,Really awful experience. The book buying process on amazon is a disaster for shared accounts as you are forced to use one click. Textbooks are often mangled and have no option to show original pages. There is no text to speech reader easily available unless you turn on talkback in accessibility on your phone which reads everything on your phone and they don't have audible versions available.(probably why there is no t2s) The worst way to buy textbooks just pay more somewhere else. Not worth it.,NEGATIVE,visual impairment,1,2020-09-18T16:40:28.450Z,

Amazon Kindle,BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE,talkback,Text to speech is basically trash with Talkback there is no TTS integration. So Amazon tries to sell you their Audible version but often there isn't even such a thing and will never be for the book you are reading.

Amazon Kindle,BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE,talkback,No text to speech feature. This guts the usefulness of the app for people who read audivly in their commute. TalkBack TTS works but poorly. It's is a paltry solution as it takes a massive amount of time and changes the functionality of your phone. This app can't read to me on the go or in my car and blocks other readers. Even if they made a fairly cheap paid app to make this easier I would buy it though I wouldn't like to buy a Kindle device. I avoid buying Kindle books due to this.,NEGATIVE,visual impairment,1,2021-12-04T04:12:26.326Z,
Amazon Kindle,BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE,talkback,Talkback does not read smoothly in Amazon Kindle and does better in other apps. Does not pause at the end of paragraph and end of each item in a list.

Amazon Kindle,BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE,talkback,I like being able to reach my books everywhere but Text-to-Speech is nonexistent Talkback on Android simply doesn't work with the Kindle and their customer support has been completely unresponsive - literally as in they don't respond. I wouldn't recommend it or recommend against it - it is what it is and you have no bargaining power against Amazon so take it or leave it is probably their own corporate attitude at this point.,NEGATIVE,visual impairment,3,2021-04-20T07:18:57.635Z,
Amazon Kindle,BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE,talkback,Does not have TTS feature. Like it's 2021. It must be inbuilt. You can access it by TalkBack.

Amazon Kindle,BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE,talkback,I store many Publications on my Android phone. When I open up a USA Today for example the publication date does not show on the first page of the text version any other page or in the article list. Lack of publication date means I cannot determine which issue I am reading in order to come back to the publication or to delete the publication. Sometimes when I tired of reading the publication I want to switch to text-to-speech. I have found it impossible to listen to page after page using Google's TalkBack. I would like to see Amazon include a text to speech setting in Kindle like they include on the Washington Post app for Android.,NEGATIVE,visual impairment,4,2017-11-11T17:34:40.690Z,
Amazon Kindle,BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE,talkback,Great app for accessing Kindle books. The highlights and quick switching of pages are some really awesome features as well as the plethora of different reading formats and syncing. I really wish the Text to Speech feature from the Kindle Fire reading app were available in Android but Amazon support states we have to suffice ourselves with Android TalkBack feature which is very annoying. There are probably commercial reasons for this...anyway overall still a great app.,NEGATIVE,visual impairment,4,2019-08-05T19:17:20.712Z,
Amazon Kindle,BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE,talkback,Visually great user interface is easy and attractive... But it's 2016 and TTS functionality is missing. I know there are workarounds like enabling 'TalkBack' in Android's accessibility settings. Or converting to different formats to use with other e-readers. These are frustrating options. I like the Kindle app. I would love to see the option for TTS built-in to the app. This would improve accessibility for people with disabilities. Even better would be using natural sounding voices.

Amazon Kindle,BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE,visually impaired,My main reason for wanting to use Kindle books was to be able to have them read to me via a 'text to speech' engine. The Kindle devices made by Amazon and most of the decent e-book reading apps include this feature but kindle for android does not. This makes the app completely useless for a visually impaired person such as myself. There is no excuse for not enabling this functionality. I am not going to carry around a separate larger device (larger than my phone) just for reading Kindle books. Instead I will purchase books elsewhere. I have been following this issue on forums for visually impaired people for years and there is a large community of people who have the same problem. Amazon is losing business because of this. Many people (not me of course) also illegally remove the DRM from their kindle books ONLY so they can have a different e-reader 'read' the book to them. Even if this is not your issue please leave a negative note for the app until they fix it. This is a basic accessibility issue. The software to fix it is commonplace and easy for them to add.

Amazon Prime Video,ENTERTAINMENT,blind,The one that stops me from giving it 5 stars is that the app does not have its own brightness adjustment and its dependent on the device's brightness settings which is really a let down especially for people who has eye health conditions.

Bitmoji,ENTERTAINMENT,blind,A lot of fun to play with and it's humorous when my boyfriend and I exchange entire conversations without using any text. The only reason I didn't give it a 5? Could bitmoji be a little more inclusive for people who are disabled aka spoonies? Wheelchair service dog hearing aids walking stick for the blind as accessories. 'Spoonie Life' w/ both a smile and a grimace for those who have invisible stuff? We share the 'best' phone (a lot) in our family. So it would be nice too be able to switch and log out of mine log into his etc. Or swap persons within one account. I guess the another dream I would have is for Petamojis with different breeds of dogs cats popular reptiles birds... especially if once you picked an animal you could change the colors or weight. Our Chihuahua is part of our family & he often has stuff to say about or to his Mom & Dad too! (I think a cat Petamoji with 'Then my human did this...' would spawn a million conversations) Last it would be awesome (as an added paid option maybe?) To be able to import/combine bitmoji profiles on the same device or account to make 'couples' or 'family' 'Me & my pet' stickers With the various default words and phrases. So there you go...add some spoonie accessories like wheelchair hearing aids etc and I will happily come back and upgrade to a five...

Bumble - Dating & Make Friends,DATING,eyestrain,better than Tinder but it needs a dark mode to reduce eyestrain for those of us who are neurodiverse (and those who use screens a lot which is everyone now). Come on it's 2020. Edit: come on it's 2021.,NEGATIVE,eyestrain,1,2021-02-08T21:17:40.709Z,
Bumble - Dating & Make Friends,DATING,vision impairment,There is no point to the paid version i tested it. They also just repeatedly show you people you have already liked or disliked because people are not using the app at scale. ( I live in a major city ). If you have the paid version and can see who likes you you realise they just show up first in the stack anyway and if you dislike them they show up again in a short amount of time. They also use dark ux/ui patterns to make it hard to remove your credit card details and then refuse refunds. Design fails accessibility and is troublesome for people with vision impairments. I raised this with them and their response was ' well other people could do it...'. Company lacks empathy and no human elements just like the app.,NEGATIVE,visual impairment,1,2018-12-02T18:46:15.564Z,

BURGER KING® App,FOOD_AND_DRINK,talkback,What a pile. I really hate web wrapper apps and that's basically what this app is now. Things are slower to react and TalkBack accessibility takes a hit because people want to be lazy. Now they've gone and changed the sign-in method so it's not a standard username/password.

Calorie Counter - MyFitnessPal,HEALTH_AND_FITNESS,blind,Old technology! Overall the app has everything I need to manage my diabetes and diet. But the UI just sucks and it's one of the few apps that absolutely ignore all requests for a dark mode. I'm partially blind and looking at a bright white screen just kills my eyes.

Calorie Counter - MyFitnessPal,HEALTH_AND_FITNESS,blind,This app has helped me in a great way to maintain a healthy diet. The only downside to it and it is not the fault of the app itself is that some of the database entries for foods are incorrect. If I had only one desire it would be that some verification procedure could be established to ensure accuracy of entries which are placed into the database . All in all this app deserves 5 stars in my humble opinion. One last thought: developers thank you for making this app accessible to blind users!

Calorie Counter - MyFitnessPal,HEALTH_AND_FITNESS,talkback,I use it with TalkBack and it repeats saying 'main activity' when I move my finger towards the bottom of the diary screen. This happens almost on 8 spots on the Diary page and is very uncomfortable. The other thing is that the add ingredient window doesn't has the 'most recent' option. I would suggest creating a connection between the 'most recent' searched foods in the add food to Diary page and add ingredients page so I can find my recent items and add them as ingredients to my new recipes.,NEGATIVE,visual impairment,4,2021-06-14T13:39:56.141Z,

Clock,ANDROID_WEAR,sight impaired,After my Pixel 5 updated to Android 12 the widget started using text colors selected by algorithm based off wallpaper color. I'm sight impaired so this makes it impossible to read the time now. I've tried using the Android accessibility options but they're obviously designed by Google engineers without vision issues who don't care. Why can't I just pick plain white text?

Clock,ANDROID_WEAR,visually impaired,Why do you want to choose low contrasting colors for menus and display screens? White on black was too basic functional and legible? Clock has joined other screens like the Contacts with low contrast colors. Light blue letters on blue background is a stupid choice if users cannot change it. There are visually impaired users who just cannot see these screens in a dimly lit room much less in daylight! Tiny type sizes that can't be changed make it even worse (company name & position in Contacts).,NEGATIVE,visual impairment,1,2015-06-20T17:19:17.315Z,

Clock,ANDROID_WEAR,visually impaired,New update is terrible. Feels large and clunky. At least give the option to select desired theme if you're argument is that it was designed to help the visually impaired.

Clock,ANDROID_WEAR,visually impaired,Why did this app change from black and white to pink and purple with the last update? I hate it! I'm on Google Play right now looking for a new alarm clock app. I am visually impaired and the black and white was helpful to me the pink and purple makes it very difficult to see. I looked all through the app for an option to change the colors but found nothing. Please put it back the way it was!

Clock,ANDROID_WEAR,weak eye,Two things for the UI/UX team: 1. The controls for snoozing an alarm on lock screen are extremely tiny and non-intuitive. Many people have weak eyes and it's just frustrating to find the tiny buttons to snooze/dismiss an alarm. They should be BIG high contrast and clear. 2. The plus button to add a new alarm is just gigantic and out of place with everything else. Yes it's material you but this must get smaller. Delicately put it's simply outrageous.,NEGATIVE,weak eyes,2,2021-11-22T20:44:06.463Z,

CNN Breaking US & World News,NEWS_AND_MAGAZINES,eye strain,I've waited for CNN to provide a setting that would allow users to switch from the current white text on black background to a standard black text on white.

CNN Breaking US & World News,NEWS_AND_MAGAZINES,eye strain,On the phone I have to infinitely scroll down to see the news. There is no option to turn the picture off for example so I can have an overview of the news items. The background changed from black to white when reading news and although it might be a personal preference white background is more eye straining and wasting battery power on some devices. I think at least a 'night mode' is needed. Font size is also a problem - it is best to be able to adjust the font size.,NEGATIVE,eyestrain,1,2014-04-24T01:44:12.260Z,
CNN Breaking US & World News,NEWS_AND_MAGAZINES,eye strain,This version of the app sucks. In the older version I did not have to scroll and scroll and scroll to see what articles I wanted to read and the way the pictures flip on on the screen causes eye strain. The app is supposed to be about news and accessing it quickly not fancy and unnecessary graphics. I will be uninstalling the app and if I want to read CNN I will go to the website.

CNN Breaking US & World News,NEWS_AND_MAGAZINES,eye strain,CNN pressurised me into 'upgrading' by sending messages that I would no longer receive alerts. I caved in and upgraded.

CNN Breaking US & World News,NEWS_AND_MAGAZINES,eyestrain,I am sorry to admit but I am officially done with the CNN app. The stories were informative and everything but the app leaves a LOT to be desired.

CNN Breaking US & World News,NEWS_AND_MAGAZINES,visually impaired,I expected more from CNN. The app is missing a basic accessibility feature namely the ability for a visually impaired person to either pinch and zoom or tap on images to make them larger. Also everytime a news article is loaded it reloads two additional times. So as a person is partway through reading an article it reloads and you have to find your place again. This happens a second time which adds to the frustration. It's kind of like someone slapping a newspaper out of your hand as your reading it. Finally some articles have a video which leads a person to believe the video will be about that particular article. Instead clicking on such videos just starts the live CNN feed so you don't get to watch what you were interested in unless it happens to be playing on the live feed when you click on it. All of this combined with slow load times (even on 4G LTE) is enough for me to switch to another news app.,NEGATIVE,visual impairment,2,2017-04-07T10:38:11.190Z,

Coinbase: Buy BTC- Ethereum- SHIB- Bitcoin Cash,FINANCE,blind,This app is great for getting into this bitcoin surge that happening right now. It's super easy to buy in and cash out. Takes all of the confusion of 'what's a wallet?' 'How do I buy coins?.... Okay now how do I sell them?' And turns it into something not dissimilar from mobile banking. Some things I would love to see improved on/added are: Dark mode! (Checking the market through this app just after waking up will blind you) Better widgits!!!! (I know not many people use them but I'd love to see how much USD I have in the market at a quick glance. Adjusting background occupancy and text color would be awesome too) More clear deduction of fees. My first time I chucked $30 from my debit card into BTC and I was wondering why only $28.01 went through when there was only a $1 fee listed.

Duolingo: language lessons,EDUCATION,"blind, visually impaired",it's not bad for people who are visually impaired so it's it's a good app I would recommend it and basically because I'm visually impaired so it really is not bad for someone who can't see for the blind alright peace out,POSITIVE,"blindness, visual impairment",5,2019-05-08T19:08:19.852Z,
Duolingo: language lessons,EDUCATION,cataract,The app us fine. I personally have trouble using it consistently as I have had cataract surgery and my eyes blur. Would prefer on larger computer. Not my ideal way of learning but it does help a lot with language/accent understanding,NEGATIVE,cataract,5,2021-11-16T03:43:41.470Z,
Duolingo: language lessons,EDUCATION,eye strain,I enjoy using duolingo but the recent UI update is not as good as the previous I don't mind keeping the new one but atleast give an option to revert back to the old UI. Also I'm disappointed that there is no NIGHT MODE doesn't make sense not to have one when most of us practice at night also helps reduce eye strain and improve battery life. Please consider night mode!,NEGATIVE,eyestrain,1,2019-01-19T23:15:48.470Z,

Duolingo: language lessons,EDUCATION,eye strain,amazing language learning tool. i have never found learning a language so much fun and made this much progress nso quickly. i deducted 1 Star as i woukd suggest addinf a feature to enable users to change the background from white to black or yellow to reduce eye strain when learning. thanks!,NEGATIVE,eyestrain,4,2019-08-16T13:09:42.714Z,
Duolingo: language lessons,EDUCATION,eye strain,Loved it. Helped me with English and now Japanese. It's amazing. A night mode would be really helpful though as it would avoid eye strain and take advantage of my AMOLED screen,NEGATIVE,eyestrain,5,2018-01-09T01:32:15.351Z,
Duolingo: language lessons,EDUCATION,eye strain,I enjoy duolingo. My knowledge in other languages is increasing quickly and efficiently. Also can you guys add a dark theme. Most of the time I work on duolingo in bed in the morning before I do anything else and it's a bit eye straining for me. Thank you,NEGATIVE,eyestrain,5,2019-11-28T22:14:36.378Z,
Duolingo: language lessons,EDUCATION,eye strain,A well designed app to kickstart your language learning. I like the dark mode it prevents eye strain and its there so that you have more learning time!,NEGATIVE,eyestrain,5,2020-09-29T22:14:33.769Z,

Duolingo: language lessons,EDUCATION,eye strain,Wow! Duolingo got 5 star just because of it's new awesome Dark mode feature which is very helpful to reduce eye strain.

Duolingo: language lessons,EDUCATION,low vision,The recent update did not make it remotely faster in fact everything is slower. The graphical bloatware is ugly and the animations are annoying and everthing lags. The only good thing I can say is that making everything SO MUCH BIGGER would be a good OPTION for people with low vision. If only it were optional. In addition it used to be I could move the banner telling me I got something wrong and see if I made a typo or not speaking of which it no longer seems to recognize obvious typos.,NEGATIVE,low vision,1,2019-03-04T10:05:59.740Z,
Duolingo: language lessons,EDUCATION,low vision,Um tema escuro tornaria o app mais acessível a pessoas com baixa visão. A dark theme would make the app more accessible to low vision people.,NEGATIVE,low vision,1,2019-07-13T00:40:37.469Z,
Duolingo: language lessons,EDUCATION,low vision,Love this app only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that it needs accessibility features. You can't zoom in. It doesnt work well with the access. features on my phone. Can't pinch and zoom. I have 2 low vision children who i wanted to use it to learn chinese....but the characters are really tiny ☹ and it makes me long for stronger reading glasses for myself. But really do love it .makes learning a new language seem fun and not work.,NEGATIVE,low vision,4,2019-11-09T14:07:33.492Z,

Duolingo: language lessons,EDUCATION,old eye,Edit: was awesome & worked great before new update. Horrible design now couldnt care less about color but tiny words really dont help my old eyes. I'd like to see new content before redesigning the app to cater toward eagle-eyed young'uns I've still got a empty bonus slot. What in the world are you developers thinking about changing it in the wrong direction that makes me think PLUS may not be worth it. :(,NEGATIVE,old eyes,2,2018-12-04T17:40:25.429Z,
Duolingo: language lessons,EDUCATION,old eye,Good experience but yellow or gold font color is hard on old eyes. Maybe change them or allow user settings,NEGATIVE,old eyes,4,2019-08-04T04:01:21.547Z,

Duolingo: language lessons,EDUCATION,screen reader,I like the modular approach but greater clarity is needed for achievements milestones awards and alternate learning paths. Also when the keyboard is active you can go to the next test by pressing enter. This should be possible at all times including word selection and general navigation like an accessible browser or screen reader.,NEGATIVE,visual impairment,4,2017-01-12T06:57:52.900Z,
Duolingo: language lessons,EDUCATION,sensitive eye,Thank you for the needed tweaks & polish to the new UX. I ❤️ the stories mode! And the inclusion of a dark mode for those of us with sensitive eyes seals the deal. Excellent app!,POSITIVE,photophobia,5,2021-12-05T03:06:23.466Z,
Duolingo: language lessons,EDUCATION,talk back,Nice and very helpful. However I hope the app will be more accessible with talk back users. Lots of unlabelled buttons.,NEGATIVE,visual impairment,4,2018-03-06T04:23:39.429Z,
Duolingo: language lessons,EDUCATION,talk back,By far the best application around to learn develop or refine language skills. And it truly is 100% free with no ads! Its a pity that the Android version doesn't seem to support the talk back feature like the iPhone version though. It would be great to have this feature added in the next update.,NEGATIVE,visual impairment,5,2013-07-15T13:42:20.981Z,

Duolingo: language lessons,EDUCATION,visually challenged,I really love this app. Its fun free and totally accessible for even the visually challenged people like me. With features like listening and speaking exercises this app is really fun to use. Helps a lot to learn new languages right from scratch for people who are eager.

Duolingo: language lessons,EDUCATION,visually impaired,I love this app. Easy to use clear layout (am visually impaired so this is important) makes learning a new language fun interesting rewarding and easy! The bite sized lessons are perfect and the combination of listening typing and speaking the words means they stick! Currently learning Spanish and Welsh but trying a bit of French too! Highly recommend this app and think I've learned more using it daily then I ever did in school! Thank you!,POSITIVE,visual impairment,5,2019-11-03T09:57:23.944Z,

eBay: Buy- sell & save money,SHOPPING,blind,I'm legally blind and the vendor had a big picture of six items. No equally large warning that there were only two items.

eBay: Buy- sell & save money,SHOPPING,blind,5 star for improvement though. The app has a long way to go still. 50 million downloads for the app that's a lot for an app that I think needs improving...

eBay: Buy- sell & save money,SHOPPING,eyestrain,***Terrible update*** 2/29/20 it's the opposite of dark mode and causes significant eyestrain now. I can no longer endorse this app not the company/website. typical presentation of a mobile app. about 75% of the full functionality. It is adequate for little tasks and updating little things. probably best just to use it for buying rather than selling. there should be a sellers app and a buyers app since they are two very different tasks.,NEGATIVE,eyestrain,1,2020-02-29T18:46:55.943Z,
eBay: Buy- sell & save money,SHOPPING,low vision,Look of app needs to be revised. The white background and the absence of any colour makes it hard to distinguish between the different headings on the homepage. Making it hard to use for people with low vision as there is no contrast. The app should be optimised for all users. Also not impressed about being forced to update my app as it would not open until I did.

This causes my tablet to lag a great deal. Please fix this!,NEGATIVE,visual impairment,1,2017-02-04T12:18:42.241Z,

Facebook,APPLICATION,visually challenged,Facebook is really a good customer based social network. Main issue is not accessible to all users for example visually challenged users. If it is accessible to them also then it will be useful to all users. Since this application is directly or indirectly associated with others apps all kinds of users should able to access it.

Facebook,APPLICATION,visually impaired,The reason I bought a tablet rather than a smartphone is that I am visually impaired so I need to be able to increase the type size.

Not that Facebook would actually listen in the first place. Videos are playing in wide screen that is to long to see the whole videos. Pages refuse to stay in landscape view. There is no way to zoom in for people with vision issues. The app and facebook period has no way to change text or background colors to help the visually impaired so I'm constantly jumping back and forth on color inversion just to be able to read or see tiny symbols to change setting or delete posts.

Facebook Lite,SOCIAL,"blind, talkback",I am a totally blind user and I use my phone and tablet with Android's built in TalkBack screenreading software to navigate my devices and read what's on the screen. My understanding before installing Facebook Lite was that it would work with TalkBack. I was quite frankly disgusted to discover that the app is completely unuseable with TalkBack or other screenreading software for the blind. With Facebook having a dedicated accessibility team there is no excuse whatsoever for this to be the case especially given the fact that both Facebook and Messenger as well as the Messenger Lite app are TalkBack compatible. So why shouldn't Facebook lite be? When I open the app for the first time I was greeted by an unlabelled image that TalkBack won't read again making it completely unuseable. Great if it uses less data/storage but alas tough luck for TalkBack users. Facebook I'm very disappointed I would have expected better from you guys.

But that doesn't matter anyway because I have gone back to the old version. I am hoping the old version will not be discontinued. If so I may be looking for a new tracker. That is really sad because I have been a fitbit user since 2014 and I really do like it. I just purchased a new Charge 2 which I received just 3 days ago. I really do like it.

That's fine. My problem is when I navigate with my Bluetooth keyboard to 'send' the Talkback or keyboard or something keeps taking me to a 'password keyboard'. The Talkback doesn't tell me the 'send' option as it should. Secondly when I compose an e-mail and I am at the fields where I type in the address subject and the e-mail the Talkback or the Gboard or something keeps saying 'help to make Gboard a better keyboard'.

Gboard - the Google Keyboard,ANDROID_WEAR,visually impaired,I used to love the Gboard and all its features. Unfortunately the last update has made the keyboard unusable. I'm visually impaired and rely on the keys vibrating to tell me I've pressed them properly but they no longer vibrate. I've tried toggling the switch for vibrate in the preferences off and on again but it's made no difference. Also the letters I type take a while to show up on screen and sometimes half a dozen of the same letter will appear so I keep having to correct my typing.,NEGATIVE,visual impairment,1,2020-12-24T00:57:10.249Z,

Gmail used to have more professional look before now it's a candy crush like app. Distracts from work environment annoying blinding circles. Developers should work on user adjustable interface not everyone likes oversaturated kiddie colors. Seriously Google??

Gmail,COMMUNICATION,eye strain,The new visual update needlessly removes color and hierarchy.. so its harder to distinguish emails from one another. I request the option to revert to the old style and the addition of a dark theme to prevent eye strain.,NEGATIVE,eyestrain,1,2019-02-20T20:19:33.926Z,
Gmail,COMMUNICATION,eye strain,Latest update is too bright and white. Also there's a complete lack of visual footholds. Does Google not care about accessibility? eye strain? ergonomics? Their UI/UX designers should take such things into consideration. P.S.: I preferred having the switch for multiple email accounts in the same left-side off-canvas menu. Having to open a separate menu to switch between Google accounts is not an optimal path of navigation.,NEGATIVE,eyestrain,1,2019-02-22T00:33:49.446Z,

Gmail,COMMUNICATION,eye strain,The new white interface is awful. There's significant research that battery life is significantly improved with dark themes at least on OLED panels 'brighter' interfaces create greater eye strain and worse for viewing in the dark. All sorts of other apps even Google apps offer a dark option. (Heck even Apple recently 'invented' a dark mode in their latest OS.)

Google LLC not listening. new look for new year is really bad still no dark mode now more white everywhere difficult to distinguish delineation from one email to the next spending more time and causing eye strain using 'new and unimproved' menus switching between mail accounts and folders.

Gmail,COMMUNICATION,eye strain,Awful awful update. First I'm now getting *over thirty times* the amount of spam emails every day. Second the multicolored logo too closely resembles other ones.

Gmail,COMMUNICATION,eye strain,Ever since the new update the app looks like an unfinished project where it is simply completely white and displeasing to look at not to mention there isn't any color option and this also makes it unbearable to work with because of eye strain if it's nighttime. The functionality is still there but the looks make you want to just go log in with your computer where you won't be blasted with white hell all over.,NEGATIVE,eyestrain,2,2019-02-23T15:07:21.740Z,
Gmail,COMMUNICATION,eye strain,I just updated this Gmail app... what a mistake! It feels so outdated and glaringly bright white (painfully so). My phone and nearly every other app I use has a dark theme or uses dark mode in order to conserve battery and eye strain. Yet the Gmail app remains behind the times. Then there are the issues with notifications being delayed by hours resulting in overlooked emails and inability to easily manage tags or folders via the app. Now I need to spend time searching for a new email app.,NEGATIVE,eyestrain,2,2019-07-04T18:19:48.788Z,

Gmail,COMMUNICATION,eye strain,Great update however the blinding white color is ridiculous... MOST users are asking for dark (black) theme which conserves battery NOT a BLINDING white theme that forces users to turn down screen brightness and or NOT open the app in dark environments as it can reduce your eyes night vision and or eye strain.... why is a pitch black background so difficult to implement❓,NEGATIVE,eyestrain,3,2019-02-20T14:05:05.510Z,

Gmail,COMMUNICATION,low vision,I love my Gmail but the update sent out on 12.3.12 took away the text size option. I'm a person with a visual handicap. Since I can't set a text size my option is now to pinch-and-zoom each individual message and scroll left-to-right to read. It's more than bad. It's more than annoying. This is discrimination on Google's part. I can't believe Google would not consider the fact that not everyone has perfect vision. Taking away an option as basic as text size is wrong. I'm disappointed by this decision and the message it sends to the low vision community. I hope Google fixes this issue before it affects their reputation.,NEGATIVE,low vision,1,2012-12-04T04:22:17.210Z,
Gmail,COMMUNICATION,low vision,I love the Gmail app but the last update to 4.2.1 crippled accessibility for users with low vision. Yes it has pinch to zoom but you have to zoom in then double tap to fit to window. It's way too much effort when we just had the option to increase text size. In the Google forums a Google rep said 'Just turn on large text system wide....' On a phone the large text looks cumbersome and doesn't fit well. We just want the option back to have large text automatically in Gmail without applying system wide font increases or having to zoom and tap everything. Come on Google. Make the right call and give us back the option to increase font size in Gmail. I will gladly rate 5 stars when this happens.,NEGATIVE,low vision,1,2012-12-07T15:18:38.609Z,
Gmail,COMMUNICATION,low vision,With so many users Gmail should be a polished app. Due to low vision I have large fonts selected on my Galaxy S10+ . Gmail has left low vision users behind. 1. The text size doesn't always change size in response to the pinch gesture. 2. After pasting selected text from a previous email the text overlapped so badly it couldn't be read to edit it. Unusable for low vision users... I tested BlueMail as an alternative and all good so it's permanent now With Google so big why can't they get Gmail get it right?.,NEGATIVE,low vision,1,2019-07-25T22:42:40.299Z,

Google,ANDROID_WEAR,blind,There's no acknowledgement sound anymore which means you're not sure if it picked up your 'OK Google'. On top of that for the past year or so it hasn't been nearly as responsive or clever as it used to be. It's quite common to press the microphone button see it listening I ask a question and it continues listening with nothing being said. This happens despite retraining my voice. Siri has gone downhill this past year as well. I really thought that voice command technology would be an ongoing hit especially on smart watches. For blind people it's essential. Now it looks as though the technology is in decline with little to no support. It's such a shame. Update - Cortana seems to be the best at the moment.

I use Google Voice for my text and calling preference. Before the update my Talkback would read it fine but now NO FEEDBACK!

Google,ANDROID_WEAR,visually impaired,I'll happily change my review to something much better but not until Google fixes a major flaw you purposely created. I'm visually impaired and as a result I rely on audible notifications. A few months ago I noticed that I was no longer hearing the sound notification when activating the voice search by saying 'OK Google'. Instead my phone vibrates which is barely noticeable. I spent a couple of weeks trying to bring the sound back to no avail. (And no my volume is not turned down or muted in any way on any level.) To my surprise I found that hundreds of thousands of people are having the same issue. And all because Google decided to 'beta test' doing away with just that sound notification WITHOUT EVEN TELLING ANYONE THEY'RE DOING IT!!! (And no... I'm NOT part of the beta testing program!) Google you didn't even give anyone a chance to opt out or put an option in settings to turn it on or off!! So until the sound notification is back by update or an option to turn it on and off in settings is introduced I'll keep your rating at 1 star. I find it disgusting and unacceptable that Google would blatantly ignore their customer's needs and wants just to 'test' such a simple thing. Especially when people like myself depend on it. I'm so disappointed that I'm seriously considering switching to using Apple devices exclusively... and I despise Apple! At least Siri is reliable and doesn't discriminate against the disabled.

That was several weeks ago and yet Google still have not rectified this problem what exactly are their development team doing?

Google,ANDROID_WEAR,visually impaired,Google the fact that you took away or discontinued the beep after you say 'ok google' has to be one of the most illogical decisions from Google. I don't know if Google realizes how vital that beep was as it prompted a phone user to start communicating with Google. Now with the beep gone one has to guess as to when Google is listening now. Also what if one is visually impaired or has phone in their pocket/purse when prompting ok Google & theres no beep to alert the user to start talking?!,NEGATIVE,visual impairment,3,2020-09-10T18:54:05.286Z,

Google Calendar,PRODUCTIVITY,blind,Had to reinstall a external calendar and now there is no option to make that calendar a different color. Having 3 different calendars default to different shades of blue is absolutely useless to color blind individuals. And I looked at the other reviews and there is no option as suggested by the app owner.,NEGATIVE,color blindness,1,2019-10-22T20:11:02.388Z,
Google Calendar,PRODUCTIVITY,blind,What happened to colors? Tomato and orange is almost the same damn color in a new version.

I can only imagine how color blind people struggle with this update.,NEGATIVE,color blindness,1,2021-10-04T21:19:10.610Z,
Google Calendar,PRODUCTIVITY,blind,The choice of different colors for different event has disappeared(I had to get a replacement phone). I'm legally blind the colors help me identify different events on my calendar. Not happy with this change!!!,NEGATIVE,legal blindness,1,2021-06-18T06:51:26.308Z,

Google Calendar,PRODUCTIVITY,blind,The first and by far the best feature to me on this update is the color labels. Being color blind is now easier to deal with on Google calendar. The five day view is not an issue for me as it is an active scrolling calendar and allows for a better view of what is going on with out opening every single item. For people that are dead set on seeing seven days at a time easy fix turn the phone sideways. Thanks Google calendar peeps!,POSITIVE,color blindness,5,2015-06-20T00:59:34.530Z,

Google Calendar,PRODUCTIVITY,eye defect,Used to be very happy with my Google calendar app however phone has just done automatic update and entire app has changed layout appearance. With new look it badly affects my genetic eye defect (which old version did not) and damages my vision. There is no way to change or adapt the app anywhere in any settings either. This is extremely bad set out for use of many customers who have health or disability issues and are dependant on phone apps...not to mention the thousands of other unhappy other customers/users on Google calendar app help forum who hate new layout and having problems with use but either being ignored entirely or given misinformed and useless incorrect advice by Google community specialists!,NEGATIVE,low vision,1,2018-09-28T14:30:21.114Z,

Google Calendar,PRODUCTIVITY,sensitive eye,Much the same as my review for the Gmail app. This calendar syncs events nicely across several devices and is very functional.

Google Calendar,PRODUCTIVITY,vision problem,I think Google calendar would be nearly perfect if it had a dark theme to save battery on the Google sanctioned Android amoled screens and for those who have vision problems with blinding white backgrounds.

Google Calendar,PRODUCTIVITY,vision problem,Worst calendar. It is very difficult to use especially because I have vision problems. I loved the previous calendar. It was very easy to use. This calender was installed on my phone after latest Samsung update. I complained to Verizon and Samsung and asked to have the old calendar put back on my phone. Both said they could not do that. Samsung said it may be able to be reinstalled the next time there is an update but..the person didn't know when that would be. Poor customer service.,NEGATIVE,visual impairment,1,2021-02-26T19:08:11.694Z,
Google Calendar,PRODUCTIVITY,vision problem,While I loved the previous version since the update I find it almost unusable - on a phone the appointments are just so white and combined with the changes to fonts etc it is EXTREMELY difficult to read (especially for those with vision problems) - there needs to be an option to have the old layout or be able to customize it or use themes (like in most apps).,NEGATIVE,visual impairment,2,2018-09-28T08:08:34.602Z,
Google Calendar,PRODUCTIVITY,vision problem,The newest update stinks! It's visually difficult to ascertain and differentiate the separation of areas. You've moved the edit button from left to upper right and have also made it difficult to see because it is now only a small pencil drawing type outline rather than a large coloured button as it was before. Please fix these issues. In fact they can be fixed without reverting back to what is was.

Google Calendar,PRODUCTIVITY,visual impairment,The font size in calendar is too small and seems to ignore the fact that I have my system font set to be as large as possible due to my visual impairment.

Google Calendar,PRODUCTIVITY,visually impaired,Before recent updates this was OK for visually impaired people if you tweeked it and used 3rd party widgets. Not so any more.

Google Calendar,PRODUCTIVITY,visually impaired,Last update not good. Why can't you leave things alone that are working well. Why the constant need to 'update' something that is perfectly fine. What happened to the colour display option? This is a blow to the visually impaired. I rely on defining different types of engagement by their colour. Please restore option ASAP.

This is going to cause eye strain for so many people myself included. I hope they listen to people and add options to modify the look of the browser because this update SUCKS. And I'll say it you still don't have a flash plugin for the mobile version. Do you hate accessibility?,NEGATIVE,eyestrain,1,2018-09-13T04:07:12.673Z,
Google Chrome: Fast & Secure,COMMUNICATION,eye strain,Update made it worse! SO WHITE AND TOO BRIGHT. warning! CAUSES MAJOR EYE STRAIN! My battery use gone up too as chrome updated and now EVERYTHING is a lot more white and too bright. No option to change it back or use a dark theme. Expect very sore eyes and lot eye strain. Going to have to find another browser now. Horrific when Google go on about. Things like earth hour/day yet don't support saving phone battery on amoled. Other then that it's the best browser but would be nice to have a dark mode to save battery when on new tabs or menus,NEGATIVE,eyestrain,1,2018-09-13T11:22:09.441Z,
Google Chrome: Fast & Secure,COMMUNICATION,eye strain,It was okay until the new update that make the background theme all white.

Google Chrome: Fast & Secure,COMMUNICATION,eye strain,In today's world of electronic displays it would seem that Google would make something as easy as night mode a standard option for all its browsers. Other companies have if nothing else for their mobile apps. Many people use their phones and pads in dark settings so a mode to ease eye strain is preferable if not necessary.

I needed a note app that would allow me to to attach the .screenshot/photo to recreate my notes and luckily after trying many I came .across this app. I now have all my notes on new phone. So far I like this .app. However I only rated it 4 stars because you cannot change the font or .use bold letters. Unless I just didn't know where to change the font. I .prefer using Ariel font as it is easy for my old eyes to read. Also wish it .would allow you to adjust the shades or choose variant or combo of the .colors you can choose for the notes to further customize them. Also don't .care for it's widget (does not look like a note app) but once I get use to .using it perhaps that won't be a problem.Thank you.,NEGATIVE,old eyes,4,2018-05-29T04:14:04.675Z,
Google Keep - Notes and Lists,ANDROID_WEAR,sensitive eye,I use this app daily and I like it.

Also I want folders or tags so I could separate notes and tasks for example. I get they want to keep it simple but it's too limited now.

Google Maps,ANDROID_WEAR,astigmatism,I like using maps in android auto and I love the offline map feature. It's super handy when travelling overseas however I HATE the blue dot icon. I have astigmatism and my sight is often blurry making offline maps very difficult for me to use on my phone because I cant always distinguish the lighter blue direction spread around the dot. Someone else has to read the map for me! Please allow users to change the icon to an arrow or something distinctive to help use maps easier.,NEGATIVE,astigmatism,3,2019-04-05T10:45:23.447Z,

Google Maps,ANDROID_WEAR,blind,Hi Google Map I have encountered a problem with this. When I turned on the blind person's location the voice over said 36 km and then the voice over did not say anything up to 30 to 36 km. Say you can update about blind persons because you don't know where they are so you can update the app to give voice over directions step by step one minute,NEGATIVE,blindness,1,2021-06-04T10:20:32.944Z,
Google Maps,ANDROID_WEAR,blind,Where are the voice directions when walking? I have to take my phone out my pocket and switch the screen on every 100m which kills my battery. Try walking 25km through a city and you'll understand. I have wired headphones playing music and all I hear are pings from maps instead of instructions. If I were blind app would be useless it's not accessible. Recently it stops rotating as I turn especially if click directions icon from google search. That's like a basic bug of 8 yrs ago resurfaced.,NEGATIVE,blindness,1,2020-03-19T17:27:27.649Z,
Google Maps,ANDROID_WEAR,blind,I don't see the reason for making a major update just like this. Compass turns randomly no zoom buttons and themes gone. Color blind here and previous version had this theme that helped alot with distinguishing roads. Why fix something not broken in the first place?

Google Maps,ANDROID_WEAR,blind,Essentially this app is well essential. Though over the years continual updates have taught me never to rely on features with which I may fall in love - e.g. Latitude or when Offline Maps disappeared (now returned). There are better Sat Nav apps out there too. Like Waze. But when planning journeys or just having a bird's eye nose-around your neighbour's garden Google Maps is the most convenient.

The weather part of the app doesn't have its old forecast of the day which was handy to see when roughly when it was going to rain/snow and how hot/cold it was going to be at certain times of that day. Now its just at temperature of now and what's its like currantly outside. Plus I miss the Dark theme. Really hate that you've taken this option away.

To start the news widget is horrible before I could just see the weather for 7 days but now I'm forced to see news updates and current weather. The news app is super bright the previous version had then option to display in dark mode so it doesn't blind you at night. The ads are overpowering the news articles now. The layout for customized news headlines are now in a hard to find subcategory. You can no longer remove topics that are not of interest. Should I go on? ** update ** dark theme is now available.

Google News - Daily Headlines,NEWS_AND_MAGAZINES,blind,Usefulness of the app gets completely negated the moment you open the news item to read. The font size is so small and there is no way to change. If you just want to read the headlines this is great app. Dev team no use of all the great features if it's not readable. Alt option of increasing the font size in system settings is not working.

First of all the videos are not labled with text which isn't detectble for screen readers which is the same on the website. This is particularly glaring since you took away google photos access from google drive i used to record programs on catchup sites and save them on google photos so doing away with the google drive access and the problem above means it is pointless. Using the movie editor is problematic as well since you are forced to use music but the app is slow also which slows you down as well. The backup and cynce feature is another problem. It is quick to snatch a photo or video that has arived in a folder that you wanted to backup but it doesn't give you a chanve to rename the file and if you did rename the file while in the backup process the original name is kept.,NEGATIVE,visual impairment,2,2019-12-10T16:32:31.630Z,

Having to scroll through a horizontal list (at top) of tiny boxes—or the tiny vertical list (below)— instead of seeing ALL (or most) of your podcast subs in one easy-to-see grid view is backwards an eye strain and frustrating.

Messages,ANDROID_WEAR,eye strain,No option to disable auto conversion of long messages to MMS causes unexpected extra costs for many users. Not acceptable. New design since September 2018 causes terrible eye strain (own and remote messages are styled so differently the eye needs to adapt back and forth constantly while reading through a conversation). The very useful feature of distinct colors per contact is gone. Instead a new dark mode which is ironically even more eye straining than the light mode.,NEGATIVE,eyestrain,1,2018-09-15T06:00:04.308Z,

I can no longer enable dark mode UNLESS I use the stock theme which is garbage and incredibly boring. This never happened prior. I think it happened after a system update but the developers need to provide an update lest I have to 1. Use a theme I don't want 2. Have to deal with eye strain (no thank you) or 3.

Having a white background within the conversation and message list is a bit eye straining. Plus having a black or dark mode available would help many devices with AMOLED screens.

Additionally upon this recent update for my LG V20 2.9.051 (Tuba_RC11_xxxhdpi.arm64-v8a.phone) Enhanced Features is missing in the Advanced section in Settings within Android Messages.

Messenger,APPLICATION,old eye,I have 3 issues with this app: 1. There is no way to make the text bigger like I am able to do with my Android's text message app. Not everyone has 18 year old eyes! 2. Biggest issue with this app is the tiny fraction of the screen devoted to the message I am in the process of typing the rest of the screen is wasted on displaying messages I've already read. I usually use voice to text for longer messages and I prefer to proofread before sending. This app is extremely difficult if not impossible to scroll through a multi-lined message for that purpose. 3. If I am sitting at my computer on FB I wish my phone would somehow know that and disable FB and FB Messenger notifications automatically (and re-enable automatically when I walk away or close FB on computer).

Microsoft Word: Edit Documents,PRODUCTIVITY,eyestrain,Update 2: They brought back the old ui which while functional is really awkward to use. I hate it. Bring back the one that is similar to the full scale pc version. Or make it an option for people who don't like the current ui. I'm taking off two stars for this. Quick update: Microsoft changed the ui with the latest update and it looks like the pc application and I'm loving it. Thanks Microsoft. Its much better than the previous ui. Also as a suggestion add a dark mode/theme to reduce battery usage eyestrain and an easy way to implement it would be to reverse the blacks and whites. Just a suggestion. Also add a way to set a few default options like page layout font font size etc. And add a recovery/repair option to the app to repair the file in case something goes wrong. Old review for an older version: The app is fine but sometimes the blinker teleports out of its spot and to another line or paragraph entirely. Some words vanish some lines automatically appear. Some words don't delete or delete other words entirely from another line. Sometimes when I paste text it doesn't stay like to should. For example if I paste bold text in a larger font from another part of the document somewhere it appears as plain text. Something italic reverts back to plain text. From the same document. This is really annoying. I have to close and restart the app to fix the problem and this usually isn't that big of a problem for me but when it take over 15-30 seconds to fully load a medium sized file (120 pages) to a large file (200+ pages) it makes me waste a lot of time. As a writer a college going student and other stuff my time is precious. And the thing is since it is a docx file I can't open it in anything other than my phone cause I don't have a laptop or computer anymore. I used to type on my computer but since having accidentally fried it this app has been my sole way of continuing with my work.

Microsoft Word: Edit Documents,PRODUCTIVITY,sensitive eye,As always Microsoft has delivered a solid brilliant application for its users.

These options are necessary due to my light sensitive eyes. Second there's no security-code protection available for opening particular documents.

Netflix,APPLICATION,blind,Never had any issue with it before but after the update where they put a seperate brightness adjuster. Yeah everytime I browse at the middle of the night in a dark room when a preview or a trailer auto plays. It would automatically adjust the brightness to an absurd amount that it would blind me. So everytime I watch it later at night you would need to watch a show with the brightness turned all the way up and adjust it manually. Why even put a separate brightness slider anyway? Fix it!,NEGATIVE,possibly photophobia,1,2019-10-25T12:01:41.000Z,
Netflix,APPLICATION,blind,The new update sucks! It is pretty much impossible to watch at night in dark room as the app automatically increase your screen brightness to a level that is very uncomfortable to watch. You can go blind pretty much! It hurts my eyes so bad. Appreciate if you can remove the seperate adaptive brightness function. It is totally unnecessary!,NEGATIVE,possibly photophobia,1,2019-12-25T11:41:36.680Z,
Netflix,APPLICATION,blind,The new update has a horrible brightness feature which is separate from the phone's brightness so when I am watching a movie at night I get blinded by Netflix every time I go to watch something. Worst of all it remembers how bright it was when you watched something during the day and will blind you with that same brightness when you start watching something at night. Another new update now prevents watched episodes from appearing with the red line at the bottom. Devs should be fired.,NEGATIVE,possibly photophobia,1,2020-06-19T07:37:01.669Z,

Netflix,APPLICATION,blind,Netflix is great. This app would be great if I could get rid of the pointless brightness slider that only servers to crank the brightness to 100% and blind me.

Netflix,APPLICATION,"blind, screen reader",I'm a Blind user of Netflix. all app would be great but there is something not accessible. Subtitles are not read by any screen reader as occurs with all the app. Something curious is that subtitles are read in some cases such as playing the anime “Hellsing” “Psycho pass” or “full metal alchemist” But not when I try to play a serie in English with subtitles.

Netflix,APPLICATION,eye strain,I am very pleased with the Netflix app with the exception of two things: (1) While viewing a movie on my Samsung Galaxy Proclaim the lights for the four buttons at the bottom of the phone (menu home back and search) do not turn off. This makes for a major eye strain while trying to enjoy the video. (2) If I pause the video to check a new notification that came through on my phone I have to click 'Resume' and reload the video when I switch back to Netflix. I'd rather it stayed loaded and I could simply press play to resume. That being said I truly treasure this app especially when I am stuck waiting somewhere like in the car while a family member goes into a store or when I'm in line and while I'm in bed and not quite ready to fall asleep.

Netflix,APPLICATION,light sensitivity,Great content but desperately lacking in features. Why doesn't Netflix allow for background play like literally every other streaming app? I nearly always multitask while watching shows on my tablet and Netfilx's refusal to allow this often forces me to watch something on a competitor's app instead. Also Netflix forces users to use its own (adjustable) brightness display which is unable to get as dark as my tablet's built in settings. As someone w/light sensitivity this is huge. Please fix?,NEGATIVE,photophobia,3,2020-08-17T06:31:23.671Z,

Netflix,APPLICATION,sight issue,I'd give a 5 star rating but for the following points.... 1. Synopsis of the program/movie has disappeared. I do like the idea of categories and tags but one needs to do research which isn't needed. Apple store has the synopsis Android does not. 2. For people with reading or eyesight issues the text on the app is too small please have that customizable. 3. An option to remove something from 'continue watching' would be nice 4. A way to check what will soon be taken off Netflix would be nice too. 5. It's difficult to find the option to give recommendations about programs Netflix should host. 6. More content on LGBT and Climate Change solutions please. A BIG PAIN: switching between apps and returning to Netflix leaves the screen without the playing drawer.

Nova Launcher,PERSONALIZATION,blind,I understand the need to have the Prime option so the developers can be paid for their work. But one thing that should NOT be a paid-for feature is resizing the icons. I am nearly blind and without being able to make my icons larger the only way I can distinguish them is by making each one a solid unique color. Which isn't what I want. There are many free features that could be Prime instead but making it impossible to resize icons without paying is ableist and limits your userbase.,NEGATIVE,visual impairment,3,2016-10-27T16:36:00.179Z,
Nova Launcher,PERSONALIZATION,"blind, low vision, screen reader, talk back",Quick way to remove pages off home screen Could you add a icon on the menu that pops up when you do a long press that would allow us to delete pages question this allows talk back screen reader users who cannot see the screen giving them the ability to delete pages easier off your home screens launcher. I would very much appreciate not having to do the swipe up to make my life and other people's lives a lot easier. I do not know if this can be done or not but the ability to have some kind of mechanism to give the blind user an indication that they are creating folders and that sort of stuff whihc is hit or miss and which is not so easy to do at the moment. these are the features i would like to see improved for the next development cycles of nova launcher as most of us blind users will be going to Android l an we would like our favorite launcher to use by blind and low vision users as well on Android.

Nova Launcher,PERSONALIZATION,low vision,I loved and swore by this application before the 4.0 update. however I reverted and am now using the 3.3 version. they decided to change the settings theme to a light beam instead of a dark theme which makes it very difficult to read.

Nova Launcher,PERSONALIZATION,visually impaired,I have tried dozens of launchers in search of one that has icons and text that can be scaled up making it accessible to those who are visually impaired and that also includes notification badges on the screen for missed IM's. I have found that all that provide the ability to enlarge icons and text require payment for this feature. I believe this is an effort to take advantage of the visually impaired community. Therefore every launcher that I have tried that has the ability to enlarge icons but only if you are willing to pay extra for this feature will be receiving only one star from me and I have tried most every launcher in the PlayStore. I will go through each and every one that I have tried that has this feature available but only if you are willing to pay extra for it and they will be receiving only one star for lack of accessibility and what I believe is a bias towards the visually impaired community and an attempt to profiteer,NEGATIVE,visual impairment,1,2017-04-06T12:18:08.204Z,

OfficeSuite - Word docs- Excel sheets- PDF files,BUSINESS,"blind, screenreader, talkback",I am a totally blind user and I use TalkBack Android's integrated screenreading software to read what is on the screen. I was surprised and dismayed to discover that OfficeSuite is not at all compatible with the TalkBack screenreader surprised given the fact that other apps from the same developers are completely TalkBack friendly. In OfficeSuite TalkBack will not read any document of any filetype making it impossible for me to read navigate through or edit documents. Also there are a lot of unlabelled buttons which TalkBack cannot identify thus it is impossible to know what said buttons do.

Ola- Safe and affordable rides,MAPS_AND_NAVIGATION,"blind, screen reader, talkback",I ha ve been using the Ola app for some time now. Had mailed a feedback earlier on mail but it bounced. I find the app largely useful however there are a couple of major issues that need to be fixed. First in Delhi at least I have observed that you won't get a cab after 9 30 at night very often. Same is the case during early morning too. Then during day time the peak rate gets far too high so unless there are worthwhile offers I look at other apps Uber has a lot more cabs at night...... The 2nd is an accessibility related issue. I am a blind person using my phone with Google's TalkBack screen reader. The Ola app is largely accessible but the driver rating section is not at all accessible. The different ratings are not read out by TalkBack one has to do a random tap and hope for the best. Hopefully these issues will be fixed pretty soon.,NEGATIVE,blindness,3,2015-11-11T18:38:50.414Z,

Even in the most recent update things didn't break in the least. That is impressive! This is yet another reason why I am very rapidly growing away from the IOS platform.

Pinterest,LIFESTYLE,eye strain,Not sure what happened but the app loads new pins but I can't do anything with it. It's completely frozen. Edited to add that I saw another review that said using the blue light filter caused the same problems. Same for me. While blue light filter is running Pinterest app completely stops working. Hopefully this gets fixed soon because I use the filter for eye strain and for night time. Fixed after recent update.,NEGATIVE,eyestrain,4,2015-09-11T18:44:02.962Z,

Also getting pins in another language and not able to translate them is another major annoyance. 2015-I am totally addicted to Pinterest and it still gets 5 stars from me!

Skype,COMMUNICATION,color-blind,Update: New UI is a steaming pile of trash that looks like it's lifted straight put of a crappy knockoff iMessenger. Please either undo this disaster or at least give us the option to go back to the old UI. Randomly crashes alot signs me out for no good reason occasionally decides to hide messages doesn't always notify me of new messages crashes alot when answering calls and is not color-blind friendly as the little status icons are hard to make out. But at least I can sometimes kind of use it to talk to my friends.,NEGATIVE,color blindness,1,2017-06-13T02:03:27.858Z,
Skype,COMMUNICATION,eye strain,My god why did you think this new update was a good idea? I have a lot of critiques for the new aperence one of wich is the issue i had with the old versions but there is still no way to increase font size. Im on my phone alot and being able to increase the size slightly would help with eye strain. More color options or a costomizable color option vecause the current one really are not working for me. The. Theres the actual chat issuse. You can no longer save or share images that are shared even though there are options for it they just never work and i have yet to find a way to change that. Pressing the enter key now just closes out of the key board? Not really sure why you added that? Now theres no way to put partitions in long messages. Also the little smiles dont move in when your picking them out and i perzonally dont have the order memorized making it really hard to tell what your actually choosing. Honestly if any company learned somthing from tge uproar with the release of windows 8 its that shouldnt *completely* change the way somthing is set up or looks all at once. No one wants to completly relearn how to use something. ALSO how do i turn of the vibration on notification?! I cant fund anything anywhere for it??? Really if you put somthing in like that there needs to be a way to turn it off and your 'tutorial' things you needed to clear with the new update dis nothing to help explain the new changes. Bottom line if i wanted messaging app that looked and worked like this i would be using face book mesanger. Your apeal was NOT being like FB messenger. Emphasis on the was.,NEGATIVE,eyestrain,1,2017-06-14T17:22:13.287Z,
Skype,COMMUNICATION,eye strain,Was fine until the devs tried to turn it into Snapchat. I don't use Snapchat I don't want Snapchat. You can no longer see who is online the text bubbles take up so much room you can only see 3 or so 1 line messages. Forced to select theme colours which give me eye strain the UI is now unintuitive and lacks settings to change things like text size and other options. Smacks of the devs talking in a meeting saying 'Look how much Snapchat is worth let's rip it off but do it really poorly'.

Snapchat,APPLICATION,light sensitivity,To whom it may concern: When snapchat last updated (2/13/19) the most glaring change I noticed was that the user profile page that shows your own story and snapcode has been changed from black to white with no option to change it back. As an individual with light sensitivity problems this is a horrible change and unfortunately I'm not sure if I can continue to use the app. If there was even just the option to change it from 'day' to 'night' it would seriously make a world of difference. ❤,NEGATIVE,photophobia,3,2019-02-14T00:29:00.528Z,
Snapchat,APPLICATION,light sensitivity,accessibility could use a little work. personally I have Epilepsy. so one of the things that is difficult for me with snapchat is that i have high light sensitivity. so flashing lights can cause me to have seizures.

Swiggy : Food Delivery | Instamart Grocery | Genie,FOOD_AND_DRINK,"blind, screen reader",I would rate the app the lowest as it is one of the most inaccessible and non-inclusive app for people with disabilities. I was a regular user of Swiggy and could manage my daily food needs using my screen reader until it got worse. I had to uninstall it eventually. with every new releases the Swiggy leadership product design and app development teams consistently ignored the needs of users with disabilities in spite of requests and today it is completely unusable by screen reader users like me. COVID has hit hard the vulnerable groups like people with disabilities and home delivery is the only safe option for blind who have difficulty following physical distancing. Instead of making the app accessible and make life safer who needs the most especially in these times Swiggy you have unfortunately chosen to exclude by not complying with legally mandated accessibility guidelines. I do hope you include accessibility right from design phase and ensure it is factored in every release. It’s not just your legal and social responsibility but also a business opportunity. It just requires you to train relevant people on inclusion of users with disabilities and on adopting accessibility guidelines meant for apps.

Swiggy : Food Delivery | Instamart Grocery | Genie,FOOD_AND_DRINK,talkback,After I posted a review of the app here I got a great response from the Swiggy team. It is so heartening to read the 'Whats's New' section of the latest update. It is great that the Swiggy team acknowledged the accessibility issues with the app and then set out to correct the same. That effort is to be greatly appreciated. After the most recent update it is now possible for a TalkBack user to order food on Swiggy. Not like the old way but using the Actions option from the TalkBack menu after focusing on a particular item. The entire menu will still not be available but on doubletapping the 'Recommended Item the next category will become available tapping on that will present the next and so on. Not ideal but functional. The positive approach of the Swiggy team indicates that they will take seriously the issue with the menu option not being TalkBack accessible even now. The menu option at the bottom of the screen is not even recognized by TalkBack. Hope with the next update they will get that sorted. The effort and commitment of the team deserves 5 stars. The end product is not quite there. So only a 4 star overall at this point.,NEGATIVE,visual impairment,4,2021-07-05T19:03:51.211Z,

The Weather Channel - Radar,WEATHER,sensitive eye,Ok...when the app first updated with the new revamp I couldn't use it because it kept stopping. Idk why but I solved that problem by simply reinstalling it. And before I did that .. I went through here reading a bunch of the latest reviews which most all of them were not good. A lot of people are disappointed in the new design and complaining about it and after reading all that... I thought it was going to be so awful and this huge mess of an app that was really complicated and have a blinding white light as people had described..etc...Then when I finally logged into it to check it out for myself... I was pleasantly surprised actually! It wasn't that bad at all! It's not that much different! I was thinking...what are all these people complaining about this so much for? Because you have to tap on the things now to open them? Big whoop! Everyone is entitled to their own likes and opinions of course and I don't mean any disrespect to anyone here but There's nothing wrong with this app! The old version was great too. It didn't need to be changed but everyone is being a little ridiculous and over dramatic about this one! It's not that hard to navigate through at all in my opinion! And if the light is too bright for those with more sensitive eyes then why don't you try turning down the light on your phones then?

The Weather Channel - Radar,WEATHER,vision impairment,It was a good app until 4.02. Many bad design choices vs the prev version: - overall poor screen real-estate utilization (lots of wasted space) requires excessive scrolling - no way to pin day’s details to stay on screen must tap to see - no way to see a concise extended forecast summary - no customization or turn off for lame backgrounds - cartoonish design reminds old desk phones with huge buttons for people with vision impairments Quite a regression from the prev version.

I don't know how the devs managed this as this problem hasn't existed and i've been using both tumblr and Twilight simultaneously for WEEKS with zero issues,NEGATIVE,"eyestrain, visual impairment",1,2016-03-05T08:45:57.676Z,
Tumblr – Culture- Art- Chaos,SOCIAL,eyestrain,Regarding Tumblr's latest update its clear it does not care about its userbase or what it thinks as they continue to run their website into the ground with even more and more disappointing updates. Pornbots still roam accounts can be taken over by them despite their 'NSFW ban' it has done absolutely nothing but inconvience artists and random users by flagging posts that have nothing remotely pornographic and with its latest change? I do not recommend this app for people with eyestrain issues.,NEGATIVE,eyestrain,1,2019-01-31T02:09:05.717Z,
Tumblr – Culture- Art- Chaos,SOCIAL,eyestrain,you're always only 2 degrees of seperation from people who violently hate you and the staff is entirely apathetic. the app itself is buggy and crashes and thanks to the latest god awful update its also a eyestrain.,NEGATIVE,eyestrain,1,2019-03-27T21:07:03.176Z,
Tumblr – Culture- Art- Chaos,SOCIAL,eyestrain,the new colors are 100% more of an eyestrain. they are ugly as sin and so is the new font,NEGATIVE,eyestrain,1,2019-02-01T21:57:37.610Z,
Tumblr – Culture- Art- Chaos,SOCIAL,eyestrain,the app is absolutely inaccessible for me now due to the high saturation causing eyestrain and headaches. Staff needs to get it together.,NEGATIVE,eyestrain,1,2019-02-02T03:11:49.422Z,
Tumblr – Culture- Art- Chaos,SOCIAL,eyestrain,never listens to their userbase- seems to actively be trying to kill their own platform. bright colours cause eyestrain December tos changes chased away majority of creators. Pornbots unharmed while sex workers suffer. complaints and questions are met with what seem to be automated responses. random posts still being flagged. I got less than half normal response due to posts being removed from fast moving tags in their first two hours. unimpressed.,NEGATIVE,eyestrain,1,2019-02-02T18:01:10.104Z,
Tumblr – Culture- Art- Chaos,SOCIAL,eyestrain,Like the IDEA of the site but a buggy app run by incompetent staff making terrible rules instead of fixing the actual problem results in a site filled with bigots. The problem was never 'female presenting nipples' you dumbasses Edit: thanks for the eyestrain hell 👏 please make this optional or something,NEGATIVE,eyestrain,1,2019-02-05T09:11:57.971Z,
Tumblr – Culture- Art- Chaos,SOCIAL,eyestrain,Honestly the staff doesn't listen to actual issues and instead 'fixes' problems nobody was complaining about. Fixes is in quotation marks because their solutions either do nothing or turns a small issue into a bigger one. For instance the most recent change to the platform was to recolor everything to be much more saturated. Not only does it look like neon threw up on the screen but the contrast creates more intense eyestrain.,NEGATIVE,eyestrain,1,2019-02-18T19:22:48.457Z,
Tumblr – Culture- Art- Chaos,SOCIAL,eyestrain,the best part of this app is how unbelievably terrible it is. the new update is heavy on eyestrain which i understand is good for some but theres no way to turn it off. theres a new group chat feature but its almost random and you cant invite people to it you just get added by tumblr itself. over half of the users are just TERRIBLE people and the site cannot moderate itself. for the love of GOD... if you havent created an account think twice. its only worth it sometimes.,NEGATIVE,eyestrain,1,2019-05-02T02:22:26.454Z,
Tumblr – Culture- Art- Chaos,SOCIAL,eyestrain,The new color change needs an off switch. I'm sure it's very helpful to some as it was meant to be.

Tumblr – Culture- Art- Chaos,SOCIAL,light sensitivity,Absolute garbage. They have updated terms for banning sexual stuff yet I still get 4 or 5 porn blogs folloine me per month. The new mobile design also hurts my eyes which I know a few people that use mobile have light sensitivity. There are still massive amounts of Nazis and Pedophile-sympathizer blogs as well. Overall this needs fixed and its not getting fixed. Do not reccomend AT ALL.,NEGATIVE,photophobia,1,2019-02-10T19:47:33.476Z,
Tumblr – Culture- Art- Chaos,SOCIAL,light sensitivity,It's broke. Constantly disconnects or connection is 'flimsy'. Hard to browse and enjoy because of this. Pornbots are still an issue.

Tumblr – Culture- Art- Chaos,SOCIAL,sight problem,Since the new update it's the worst ever! I get a migraine just by opening the app from the high contrast now. Please make it an option to have the higher contrast instead of 'forcing' it on everyone. While it may be good for some people with eyesight problemsmost of the people are experiencing problems by just looking at the screen. Deffo a big thumbs down! Can't use the app anymore.

Tumblr – Culture- Art- Chaos,SOCIAL,vision problem,While the abilities to add an image to a text post or change the font thereof are appreciated there are still a number of functionality and useability issues that have yet to be resolved and/or have arisen with this new mobile update. 1. The search function still turns up no results on my own blogs regardless of whether the search bar's content is correctly typed. This error has been present for at least three updates. 2. Please put the tabs bar back on the top of the screen - or add a function for individual users to choose whether it's on the top or the bottom of the screen. This change implemented in the previous update was not only unnecessary and pointless but also unexpected thereby causing many users (myself included) to experience mental distress. Your userbase is made up of an overwhelmingly large number of people with mental illnesses. These mental illnesses can sometimes be caused to flare when the person is exposed to a sudden and unexpected change. 3. The new blue bubble around tags being typed is distracting at best and a major accessibility issue at worst. For those with vision problems the blue bubble may make it impossible to proofread the text within regardless of the color of said text. 4. The fact that tags being typed may be cut off by an ellipsis makes proofreading difficult even for those with healthy eyesight and even more so for those with memory issues (such as myself and several of my friends who also use this app). 5. The clickable area for adding tags to a post is now smaller. This makes tagging less accessible to those with vision problems and/or poor fine-motor control. The previous interface which provided a long bar as the clickable area was much more accessible. 6. It now takes more steps to create tag and choose the posting time of both new posts and reblogs. The previous interface was much more efficient and user-friendly. 7. While the new ability to read every tag on a post without scrolling is appreciated the 'See All' command often does not show all proceeding tags. It often cuts out proceeding tags that are shorter than three words each. 8. This final note is more of a personal preference but the personal preferences of your userbase are still things you should take into consideration when formulating an update. A return of the full-page list of a user's blogs/sideblogs from which said user could access any of their blogs or blogs' settings they needed to would be highly appreciated. Thank you for your time.,NEGATIVE,visual impairment,3,2017-08-29T23:22:13.784Z,
Tumblr – Culture- Art- Chaos,SOCIAL,visual impairment,this las update with the color and the font change is riduculous. I was on the app for LITERALLY 2 MINUTES and I got a migraine. 'its better for some people with visual impairments' my ass. When you have a social media platform like this you need to have it cater to the majority. If anything put it in labs so those who want it can use it. side note since the NSFW ban most of my followers have been porn bots. so thanks for that ig.,NEGATIVE,visual impairment,1,2019-02-01T03:03:11.979Z,

Twitter,APPLICATION,"blind, screenreader, talkback, visually impaired",I've been using Twitter for Android since last year and I'm glad to see that for the most part the app is very accessible with the TalkBack screenreader for blind and visually impaired users like myself. I have noticed however that there are a couple of bugs which need to be addressed and squashed. Firstly when reading direct messages (especially longer DM's) TalkBack doesn't read the message in its entirety. Instead it reads a couple of sentences or lines after which it refreshes and reads again from the beginning of said message. In some cases the TalkBack focus moves to an earlier or later message as it is reading a specific one within that specific conversation window. Also in the Home tab TalkBack doesn't focus on the first tweet on my timeline and I have to scroll all the way up until I find it. I'm very disappointed to see that these two issues have not been fixed in the latest update! Please fix!,NEGATIVE,"blindness, visual impairment",4,2017-05-16T12:44:05.946Z,

Good .thing the 'block' function works. There are also a number of bugs still .present: I frequently have to close and reopen the app as it stops working .at the exact moment that I send a tweet the 'sending tweet' notification .remaining in my notifications until I click on it which deletes the tweet .without sending. Very annoying. The app also seems to dislike it when I use .a notification to open it and usually I give up waiting for that to work .and use the icon instead. Hopefully these can be fixed and I can update my .rating!,POSITIVE,visual impairment,3,2018-07-30T08:02:35.109Z,

Not courteous enough will talk back sometimes misbehave act moody are always in a rush etc. Some Moto drivers show road rage bumping into three wheelers and such! It seems they have limited knowledge about how to use the app properly. Also the app needs to support the native language of the respective county of operation specially for drivers. And I mean independent language selection which doesn't use the phone's set language. The map of Dhaka city needs major update. Routes show roads that aren't physically there. There are frequent GPS errors that cause over charged fair Uber of course refunds the amount charged extra upon placing a complaint but after a review which is a hassle. The drivers need to carry a warm clothe with them as they feel cold and don't want to turn up the air conditioner of the vehicle while the riders in the back seat feel hot!

Wattpad - Read & Write Stories,BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE,sight problem,I use this app daily and love it! I would love it even more if you added two things. 1) be able to send photos through Private Message. 2) an audio book option. Authors can record themselves reading each chapter and people who have eyesight problems or people who rather listen can now! It's very practical. Add these two things and you've got yourself 5 stars!!!!,POSITIVE,visual impairment,4,2016-09-01T22:51:19.210Z,
Wattpad - Read & Write Stories,BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE,sight problem,Absolutely amazing! So many opportunities to become a better writer and reader. It is be FAR the best thing that I have come across.

Wattpad - Read & Write Stories,BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE,vision issues,As a Wattpad user for over five years I can fully say it used to be the .best a for reading writing and reviewing books: key phrase being used to .be. Running Issues: 1) TOO MANY ADS- I fully support Wattpad having ads in .order to support the creators of this app but having to watch a 30s video .every other chapter is ridiculous. 2) POOR PUBLISHING- This one they seemed .to have fixed but it can still be a problem. Sometimes a user can publish .a story but it doesn't actually publish it or it doesn't show everything .the author wrote to the author. (i.e. the author writes some then comes .back and writes more later. The stuff written later won't show to the .author in the published chapter in reader mode but it will show for other .readers.) Also chapters often have “revision issues” not allowing it to be .published. Sometimes I have this issue 4-5 times to publish a chapter .other times it's not a problem. 3) MESSAGE BOARD- Message board (where one .can pm others) is often down and doesn't send messages through always and .it doesn't always update if new messages are received. 4) POOR CUSTOMER .SERVICE- Wattpad help is where you can message a bot and then message the .support team if there is an issue however the bots are next to useless. .With limited dialogue they can understand they often just pick out words .they know and decide what you clearly should be asking. As for messaging .support It only appears as on the actual site not app and I have tried .this only to find no message actually goes through. Overall I rate 3 stars .only because I loved it so much-it really deserves one or maybe two. It has .become a disappointment. All four of these issues have exist for at least 6 .months and have not been fixed in any updates. I was tempted to upgrade to .Wattpad premium but I'm not willing to pay money for a glitchy app with no .customer service.,NEGATIVE,visual impairment,3,2018-07-29T13:38:05.827Z,
Wattpad - Read & Write Stories,BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE,vision issues,The app started off great but recently they've been changing the look and feel of the app for example they had an option to read the books with a black background which helps with my vision issues making it easier on my eyes to read but they changed that so now it's a weird grey color. They added an offline reading option which is cool but now if you were reading a book and close the app you have to scroll through all the books saved in offline to try and find your recent reads.,NEGATIVE,visual impairment,3,2020-03-22T07:45:59.667Z,

Wattpad - Read & Write Stories,BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE,visually impaired,Negatives: The Wattpad stars and Paid Stories authors need a grammar and spell checker.

Waze - GPS- Maps- Traffic Alerts & Live Navigation,MAPS_AND_NAVIGATION,astigmatism,I haven't needed the app for a couple of months...but when I do I love it! Particularly at night. Astigmatism turns headlights into giant blazing stars for me so this sweet app sees much better than I in dark and less than familiar places. LOVE getting real time traffic/hazard/roadwork updates.

Waze - GPS- Maps- Traffic Alerts & Live Navigation,MAPS_AND_NAVIGATION,blind,Vehicle purpose apps should consider not to blind the driver at night driving. ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN - CAUSED BY THE APP!

Waze - GPS- Maps- Traffic Alerts & Live Navigation,MAPS_AND_NAVIGATION,blind,Waze sometimes is not accessible and the app sometimes doesn't provide the correct street names.

Waze - GPS- Maps- Traffic Alerts & Live Navigation,MAPS_AND_NAVIGATION,color-blind,Update: Was 5 stars. Not a fan of the version 4 changes. The comic animations are cute but the interface changes have me spending more time looking at the screen to do anything (instead of the road). Removing the ability to report issues on the other side of the road was foolish and cutting down color palettes from many to two neither of which are color-blind friendly was equally foolish.

It's definitely fast and having other users warn about police officers traffic and gas prices is very helpful. I would say my only problem with this app is the aesthetics. There are not many options to customize how the map looks. I'm colorblind (protanopia) and it can at times be hard to distinguish between different path/road colors.

YouTube,VIDEO_PLAYERS,blind,Honestly I feel like youtube should follow what twitter has done with the 'night mode' feature as some people stay up late at night watching videos. Currently I'm not sure if youtube has a night mode setting but if it doesn't that would be a great thing to add in-But not ONLY for YTR users but for normal users as well. It would actually be pretty great to not exit a video only to have the bright white light blind me mid-search for the next video.

At least want an option to view videos on a nice clean list like it was. I do not want the 'recommended' videos in my subscription feed. I want to see the upload date before I click. Having to hit the one little pause button instead of the whole screen is a backwards move.

I'm not sure what is causing it to launch and start reading aloud?

YouVersion Bible App + Audio,BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE,visually impaired,This is well put together. Easy to navigate keep bookmark and organize notes. I particularly enjoy the fact that this Bible is audible. Being visually impaired it makes it easy to memorize Scripture. I just wish I could get the audio reader to only read the verses that are highlighted instead of having to listen to the entire chapter and scroll through it to find the verse or versus I'm looking for. it would make it that much easier to memorize Scripture.,POSITIVE,visual impairment,4,2015-08-04T12:13:20.992Z,

ZEDGE™ Wallpapers & Ringtones,PERSONALIZATION,"blindness, color blindness, visual impairment",With a bit of extra personalization such as full theme control with [drag&drop?] action button placement button orientation plus real time visible rating for items and a few other customization options full control to make the app tailored for ability to acquire/quick creation/ implement & even share items could top out the potential for this great app. Having the hud control to make my experience tailored for my needs is worth the time spent setting it up if it must be done via geometric coordinate mapping with quadrant alignment instead of drag & drop [assuming the viewable screen display is provided though not restricting placement for say a 3 square button to take up 1 spot at the scrn edge with scrolling marquee text or that all buttons be resizable down to 5pt font with available screen graph size allocated to xy:3590 or similar]. Color control inversion and color blindness options are a major bonus for those with visual impairment difficulties granted you can't please everyone but abilities we have available that are not implemented is a bit of a let down. All that being said keep up the good work! I've used this app off and on for quite a few devices and the only restrictions for the dl db are items yet to be uploaded by the user base.,NEGATIVE,"color blindness, visual impairment",4,2018-03-13T05:54:47.606Z,

ZEDGE™ Wallpapers & Ringtones,PERSONALIZATION,screen reader,On the whole the app isn't bad. Downloading a selected tone is self explanatory once the button is located. However it is difficult to search for specific types of tones. Furthermore the app needs drastic improvements in fairness for screen reader users. Unlabelled buttons and ads with exit buttons not shown by the screen reader make the app incredibly invasive and difficult to negotiate.,NEGATIVE,visual impairment,3,2019-11-22T15:25:21.597Z,

Second there is no easy and direct way to delete wallpapers. I have vision issues that make it such that a wallpaper looks great until my icons are over top.
